# The pH-Dependent Allosteric Response of the Wild-Type SARS-CoV-2 Variant In The Presence of Linoleic Acid

The recent findings of Toelzer et al. highlight a free fatty acid site in-between each receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike which when bound to by linoleic acid, induce a specific locked conformation by where the receptor-binding domain units of the virion are occluded. Oliveira et al. through using a novel molecular simulation method: D-NEMD, demonstrated upon removal of linoleic acid from the site, the spike undergoes allosteric changes within specific functional domains. Haddrell et al. have also highlighted the effects of pH, particularly alkaline conditions of greater than pH 10 which can reduce the air-borne stability of the virus.
